    "## Introduction and Motivation - Predicting Air-Out Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on predicting air-out probabilities for batted balls in Minor League Baseball using data from the 2023 season. The dataset includes detailed play metadata, Trackman hit tracking information, and player-level defensive metrics. The primary goal is to build a model to estimate the likelihood of a batted ball being caught for an out (p_airout) and provide actionable insights for player development and coaching decisions. Additionally, I will evaluate the defensive performance of a specific player to inform coaching strategies and organizational planning."

    "My first step will be to explore the provided datasets and the data dictionary to understand the meaning and relevance of each feature. I expect key features such as exit speed, spin rate, vertical and horizontal angles, and player handedness to play a significant role in predicting whether a ball will result in an air out. During preprocessing, missing values will need to be handled—numerical features might be imputed with their mean values, and categorical features like bat_side, pitch_side, and level will need to be encoded. Ensuring that the features in the test dataset align perfectly with the training dataset is important to avoid prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial model selection will then begin with a simple Logistic Regression to establish a baseline because its interpretability and ease of use for binary classification problems. Following this, I will use a random forest model and then compare the two models using log loss. After this, the best performing model target values will be added to the csv file. \n",
    "\n",
    "I expect the random forest model to perform better because batted ball metrics interact with eachother and the random forest can capture these interactions better than a logistic regression model."

This report breaks down his performance based on actual fielding opportunities—those in which he was the first fielder involved, indicating that he had a realistic chance to make a play.\n",

    "Total Plays: 1,121\n",
    "Left Field: 0 plays\n",
    "Center Field: 1,121 plays\n",
    "Right Field: 0 plays\n",
    "True Fielding Opportunities (as First Fielder): 525\n",
    "Successful Air Outs: 525\n",
    "Air Out Rate: 100%\n",
    "The true fielding opportunities reflect only the plays where Player #15411 was the first fielder involved, meaning the balls were fielded by him or were within his reach. Out of these 525 opportunities, Player #15411 successfully converted 100% of them into outs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional Analysis:\n",
    "Player #15411 was deployed exclusively in center field, without any appearances in left or right field. This suggests the coaching staff views him as a specialized center fielder, responsible for covering significant ground. His ability to convert every fielding opportunity into an out speaks to his excellent positioning, range, and reliability. The absence of appearances in the corner outfield positions likely indicates that the team values his athleticism and defensive instincts at the heart of the outfield, where coverage responsibilities are more demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths and Abilities:\n",
    "Perfect Air Out Rate (100%):\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting all 525 opportunities into outs demonstrates Player #15411’s ability to consistently make plays on balls within his reach. This reflects a high level of anticipation, field awareness, and reliability in center field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand Positional Versatility: Developing experience in left and right field would increase his flexibility, allowing the team to use him in various roles based on matchups and lineup needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work on Difficult Plays Beyond Reach: Although the data shows perfect performance on reachable balls, focusing on drills that improve reaction time and range could extend his impact to more difficult plays—such as high-velocity line drives or balls requiring diving catches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Player #15411 demonstrated outstanding defensive performance during the 2023 season, converting 100% of his 525 fielding opportunities into outs. His exclusive deployment in center field reflects the coaching staff’s trust in his athleticism, reliability, and ability to cover ground effectively. With further development in positional versatility and advanced playmaking skills, Player #15411 has the potential to become a special defensive asset."
