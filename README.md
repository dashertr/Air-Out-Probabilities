# Air-Out-Probabilities
A Python-based project analyzing player defensive performance in baseball. Includes data preprocessing, predictive modeling with logistic regression and random forests, and defensive metrics calculations. Outputs player-specific insights like air-out rates, positional plays, and performance summaries for informed decision-making.
